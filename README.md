## 🎮 How to Play

### Quick Start
1. **Choose 2 Weapons**: Select a primary and secondary weapons from 5 classes. Each weapon starts off with their 'Q' ability by default. 
3. **Level Up**: Gain experience by eliminating enemy players and their summoned units.
4. **Unlock Abilities**: Start with 2 skill points. Spend skill points every level on new abilities.
5. **Master Combat**: Switch weapons mid-fight and combine abilities for devastating combos

### 📜 Game Format and Rules
- Each player has a Tower and 3 Inhibitors.
- Each player's Tower summons 3 Units every 45 seconds.
- Player kills and Summoned Unit kills award experience points.
- Leveling up grants a Skill Point to unlock additional abilities.
- Players respawn upon 12.5 seconds after death.
- Only Summoned Units can damage the opposing player's Tower.
- Players can destroy the opposing player's Inhibitors to upgrade their Summoned Units into ELITES.
- The first player to destroy the opposing player's Tower wins.

### 🏆 Game Objectives
- Defend your Tower from the enemy player's Summoned Units.
- Defend your Inhibitors from the enemy Player.
- Use your Summoned Units to damage the enemy Player's Tower.
- Destroy the enemy Player's Inhibitors to upgrade your Summoned Units into ELITES.

    shape.quadraticCurveTo(2.15, 0.05, 2.35, 0.225);   // Sharp point

    // Lower edge with pronounced curves
    shape.quadraticCurveTo(2.125, -0.125, 2.0, -0.25);  // Start curve from tip
    shape.quadraticCurveTo(1.8, -0.45, 1.675, -0.55);   // Peak of the curve
    shape.quadraticCurveTo(0.9, -0.35, 0.125, -0.325);  // Curve back towards guard
    ```

    // Only entities with Transform AND Movement components
    entities.forEach(entity => { /* process */ });
  }
}
```

#### **Event-Driven Communication**
```typescript
// Systems communicate through world events
world.emitEvent('player_damaged', { playerId, damage, source });
world.emitEvent('enemy_killed', { enemyId, killerId });

// Other systems can listen for these events
const events = world.getEvents('enemy_killed');
```

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with component type checking

## 🧠 Complex State Management Architecture

The game's architecture manages multiple interconnected state systems simultaneously to maintain smooth real-time gameplay across multiplayer environments. Here's how complex state synchronization keeps the game running:

### Multiplayer State Synchronization

#### **Client-Server State Reconciliation**
- **Network Batching**: State updates batched per frame to reduce network overhead while maintaining real-time feel
- **Authoritative Server**: Server maintains true game state, clients interpolate for smooth visuals
- **Conflict Resolution**: Server-authoritative decisions for critical gameplay elements (damage, positioning, ability activation)

```typescript
// State batching prevents network spam while maintaining responsiveness
private batchStateUpdate(updates: any[]): void {
  if (this.stateBatch.length === 0) {
    setTimeout(() => this.flushBatch(), 16); // ~60fps batching
  }
  this.stateBatch.push(...updates);
}
```

#### **Entity State Propagation**
- **Selective Broadcasting**: Only relevant state changes broadcast to reduce bandwidth (position updates every 50ms, health changes immediate)
- **Delta Compression**: Only changed values transmitted, not full state snapshots
- **Prediction & Reconciliation**: Client-side prediction with server reconciliation for responsive feel

### Combat State Management

#### **Damage Calculation Pipeline**
```typescript
// Damage flows through multiple systems with state validation
1. DamageCalculator.calculateDamage() → base damage with crits
2. CombatSystem.queueDamage() → validation and queuing
3. DamageNumberManager.addDamageNumber() → visual feedback
4. Network broadcast → synchronize across clients
```

#### **Ability State Coordination**
- **Cooldown Tracking**: Per-weapon ability states with network synchronization
- **Charge Management**: Real-time charge progress tracking across client/server
- **State Dependencies**: Abilities check multiple state conditions (mana, cooldowns, weapon type)

```typescript
// Complex state checks prevent invalid ability usage
private canActivateAbility(abilityType: string): boolean {
  return this.checkManaCost() &&
         this.checkCooldown(abilityType) &&
         this.checkWeaponCompatibility() &&
         this.checkPlayerState();
}
```

### Player State Management

#### **Weapon & Ability States**
- **Dual Weapon System**: Primary/secondary weapon states with hotkey switching
- **Subclass Management**: Weapon subclasses with unique ability sets
- **Skill Point Progression**: Unlocked abilities tracked per weapon/slot combination

#### **Health & Resource States**
- **Multi-layered Health**: Base health + shield + regeneration mechanics
- **Mana System**: Runeblade-specific resource with consumption/regeneration
- **Debuff State Tracking**: Multiple concurrent effects (frozen, slowed, stunned, burning) with durations

### Performance State Management

#### **Object Pooling State**
```typescript
// Pooled objects maintain internal state for reuse
class ProjectilePool {
  private activeProjectiles: Map<string, ProjectileState>;
  private availablePool: ProjectileState[];

  getProjectile(): ProjectileState {
    const projectile = this.availablePool.pop() || new ProjectileState();
    projectile.reset(); // Clean state for reuse
    return projectile;
  }
}
```

#### **LOD State Management**
- **Distance-Based State**: Entities transition between detail levels automatically
- **Culling States**: Frustum culling + occlusion culling state management
- **Render State Batching**: Instanced meshes maintain individual state within optimized batches

### Network State Reliability

#### **Connection State Management**
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Socket.io with exponential backoff reconnection
- **State Synchronization**: Full state resync on reconnection to prevent desynchronization
- **Latency Compensation**: Client-side prediction with server validation

#### **Error Recovery States**
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating during network issues
- **State Validation**: Server-side validation prevents invalid state transitions
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Critical state rollbacks when network conflicts detected

### State Debugging & Monitoring

#### **Performance State Tracking**
- **FPS Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics with automatic optimization triggers
- **Memory State**: Object pool utilization tracking to prevent memory leaks
- **Network State**: Latency, packet loss, and state synchronization monitoring

```typescript
// Performance monitoring maintains system health
private monitorSystemHealth(): void {
  if (this.fps < 30) this.enableLowPowerMode();
  if (this.memoryUsage > 0.8) this.triggerGarbageCollection();
  if (this.networkLatency > 100) this.reduceUpdateFrequency();
}
```
