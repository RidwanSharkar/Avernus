## 🏗️ Entity Component System (ECS) Architecture

Nocturne's core architecture is built around a high-performance Entity Component System that enables modular, scalable game development. This pattern separates data (Components) from logic (Systems) and provides flexible entity composition.

### Core ECS Classes

#### **Entity** (`Entity.ts`)
- **Unique Identification**: Each entity has a unique auto-incrementing ID
- **Component Container**: Map-based storage of components with type-safe access
- **Component Queries**: Efficient checking for required component combinations
- **Lifecycle Management**: Active/inactive states and cleanup callbacks
- **User Data**: Arbitrary data storage for game-specific information

```typescript
const player = world.createEntity();
player.addComponent(new Transform(new Vector3(0, 0, 0)));
player.addComponent(new Movement(3.75, 0.8)); // speed, friction
player.addComponent(new Health(1000));
```

#### **Component** (`Component.ts`)
- **Abstract Base Class**: All components inherit from `Component`
- **Reset Method**: Required for object pooling cleanup
- **Enabled Flag**: Runtime component activation/deactivation
- **Explicit Type Identifiers**: String-based component identification for performance

#### **System** (`System.ts`)
- **Component Requirements**: Array of required component types for entity filtering
- **Priority System**: Lower numbers execute first (0-100 range)
- **Lifecycle Callbacks**: `onEntityAdded`, `onEntityRemoved`, `onEnable`, `onDisable`
- **Specialized Subclasses**: `RenderSystem`, `PhysicsSystem` for different update types

#### **World** (`World.ts`)
- **Entity Registry**: Central management of all entities
- **System Orchestration**: Priority-sorted system execution
- **Component Pooling**: Automatic object pooling for performance
- **Event System**: Inter-system communication
- **Query System**: Efficient entity filtering by component combinations

```typescript
const world = new World();

// Add systems in priority order
world.addSystem(new MovementSystem(inputManager)); // priority 10
world.addSystem(new CollisionSystem());           // priority 20
world.addSystem(new CombatSystem(world));         // priority 30

// Main game loop
world.update(deltaTime);
world.fixedUpdate(fixedDeltaTime);
world.render(deltaTime);
```

### Component Types

#### **Core Components**
- **Transform**: Position, rotation, scale with matrix caching and parent-child hierarchies
- **Movement**: Physics simulation with velocity, acceleration, friction, and movement flags
- **Health**: Damage/healing system with regeneration, invulnerability, and death states
- **Shield**: Damage absorption with regeneration mechanics

#### **Gameplay Components**
- **Enemy**: AI behavior, target tracking, and enemy-specific properties
- **Projectile**: Bullet/projectile simulation with lifetime and collision detection
- **Tower**: Defensive structures with health and ownership
- **Pillar**: Destructible map objectives with health tracking
- **SummonedUnit**: Temporary allied units with ownership and targeting

#### **Rendering Components**
- **Renderer**: Visual representation with material and geometry management
- **HealthBar**: UI health display with dynamic positioning
- **Collider**: Collision detection shapes and boundaries

### System Architecture

#### **Update Systems** (60 FPS)
- **MovementSystem**: WASD input, physics simulation, dash mechanics
- **CombatSystem**: Damage calculation, healing, death handling
- **ControlSystem**: Player input, weapon switching, ability management
- **CollisionSystem**: Spatial hash collision detection
- **AudioSystem**: Spatial audio positioning and playback

#### **Render Systems** (60 FPS)
- **RenderSystem**: Three.js rendering with LOD management
- **CameraSystem**: Dynamic camera positioning and smoothing
- **HealthBarSystem**: Health bar positioning and updates

#### **Physics Systems** (Fixed Timestep)
- **PhysicsSystem**: Fixed-timestep physics simulation for consistency

### Performance Optimizations

#### **Component Pooling**
```typescript
// World automatically pools components for reuse
const transform = world.createComponent(Transform); // Reused from pool
world.returnComponent(transform); // Returned to pool for next use
```

#### **Entity Queries**
```typescript
// Query entities with specific component combinations
const enemies = world.queryEntities([Transform, Movement, Enemy]);
const projectiles = world.queryEntities([Transform, Projectile]);
```

#### **System Matching**
```typescript
// Systems only process entities with required components
class MovementSystem extends System {
  readonly requiredComponents = [Transform, Movement];

  update(entities: Entity[], deltaTime: number) {
    // Only entities with Transform AND Movement components
    entities.forEach(entity => { /* process */ });
  }
}
```

#### **Event-Driven Communication**
```typescript
// Systems communicate through world events
world.emitEvent('player_damaged', { playerId, damage, source });
world.emitEvent('enemy_killed', { enemyId, killerId });

// Other systems can listen for these events
const events = world.getEvents('enemy_killed');
```

### ECS Benefits

- **Modularity**: Components and systems are independent and reusable
- **Performance**: Only relevant systems process relevant entities
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new entity types and behaviors
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of data and logic
- **Memory Efficiency**: Object pooling prevents garbage collection spikes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with component type checking

This ECS architecture enables Nocturne to handle hundreds of entities simultaneously while maintaining smooth 60 FPS performance and providing a foundation for easy feature expansion.
